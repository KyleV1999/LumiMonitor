		<h2>Created Budget and Met With Collaborator - 24/09/2019</h2>
		<p>
		  Today my group and I met with our industry collaborator here at Humber College. He agreed with our ideas to design the Lumi monitor into a mobile. He also agreed with 
		  the sensors we are using and gave me the idea to use my motion sensor to record hands free feeding data. Finally he showed us a previous prototype of the Lumi Monitor. 
		  Our group deiced to use the Raspberry Pi as a development platform. 
			
		  My group also came up with an individual budget for our project which can be found <a href="https://github.com/KyleV1999/LumiMonitor/blob/master/Documentation/Lumi%20Monitor%20Budget.pdf"><u>here</u></a>.
