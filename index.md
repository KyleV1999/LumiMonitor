	        <h2>Breadboard and PCB Design - 15/10/2019</h2>
		<p>Designed the breadboad and PCB for the Grove PIR Motion Sensor. Fritzing did not have the Grove PIR Motion sensor
		included in the list of parts; I couldn't find a PIR Motion Sensor Part with 4 Pins online either. Instead, for the                     diagrams I used the Grove Light Sensor. It has the exact same pin layout as the Motion Sensor using the same connector.                  </p>

	        <h2> Additonal Purchase & Recieve Products - 8/10/2019</h2>
		<p>The items that I purchased below were delivered. I setup the Raspberry Pi with an operating system. in this case
		Raspian with kernal 4.19, installed on my 32GB micro SD card. I also configured SSH and VNC viewer so I can connect and 			control the Pi remotely. I also forgot to purchase a socket for my mootion sensor so that it can connect to the PCB. I                   puchased 10 <a href ="https://bit.ly/32it9vh"><u>Seeedstudio Grove 4-pin Connectors</u></a></p>

		<h2>Created Budget and Met With Collaborator - 24/09/2019</h2>
		<p>
		  Today my group and I met with our industry collaborator here at Humber College. He agreed with our ideas to design the Lumi monitor into a mobile. He also agreed with 
		  the sensors we are using and gave me the idea to use my motion sensor to record hands free feeding data. Finally he showed us a previous prototype of the Lumi Monitor. 
		  Our group decided to use the Raspberry Pi as a development platform. 
			
		  My group also came up with an individual budget for our project which can be found <a href="https://github.com/KyleV1999/LumiMonitor/blob/master/Documentation/Lumi%20Monitor%20Budget.pdf"><u>here</u></a>.

		<h2>Constructed Project Plan and Schedule - 17/09/2019</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/KyleV1999/LumiMonitor/blob/master/Documentation/Project%20Schedual.pdf">
		<u>Detailed Schedule Here</u></a>
		<br>This is an estimated schedule / time frame my group will try to stick to when developing the Lumi Monitor over the next two semesters.
