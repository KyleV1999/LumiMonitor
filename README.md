## Introduction

This is the build instructions for building the PIR Motion sensor as part of the LumiMonitor project. The PIR (Passive Infared) Motion Sensor will detect motion within 3 meters of the sensor. These instuction will show you how to design and build the breadboard and PCB circuits to intigrate the sensor with a Broadcom Development Platform (Raspberry Pi 3B+). I will also provide a list of materials and links to where you can buy them, as well as a Corel Draw file so that you can laser cut a case out of clear acrylic. These instutions take into account that you will have access to equipment such as a soldering iron, laser cutter, wire strippers, etc. The PIR Motion Sensor will be used in the final Lumi Monitor project to intiate hands-free data collection. The photo below depicts the final product:

Before you begin some skills you will need duing the build of this project include:
* Basic electrical and circuit knowledge
* Basic programming knowledge
  * This project specifically was programmed in Python
* Basic understanding of the Raspberry Pi and Linux based operating systems
* Soldering
